# AI-Bot
All encompassing bot for Discord

--Self Role Assignment--
Currently the bot will allow a user to assign a role to themselves only after executing the accept command.  This allows the restriction of channels to a rules and welcome channel where the user would need to accept the terms to get the member role.  After this role exists the member can use the !iam command to assign roles to themselves.

*This has not be filtered down yet for mods roles which may currently allow the self assignment of that type of role.  It wont allow the administrator role to be assigned.

--Role Validation--
You can add the RoleValidation tag to any command to restrict which group of users can be executing that command.


Check back for updates as we continue to expand the functionality of the bot.
